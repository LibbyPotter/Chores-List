# Chores-List
To-do list for chores
When the script is run in VSCode you will see a menu for functions you can use to modify your list. Input the number of the function you wish to use and follow the instructions for said function. If asked to about a task, input the full name of said task, and if asked about a position input the number value for that position. Your list will not be shown to you unless you choose '2. View List', if you wish to see your changes, choose option 2 on the main menu.
